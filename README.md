# Data
The abdominal dataset used in the paper can be found in [here](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). The pancreas dataset was comprised of patients undergoing resection of pancreatic masses. Images were provided by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre located in New York, United States. Among the 420 images, 281 have corresponding segmentation information on pancreatic parenchyma and pancreatic mass. Full description of the dataset can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09063.pdf).
