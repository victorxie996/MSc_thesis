# MSc_thesis
This repository is implementation of my MSc dissertation "Deep Learning for Abdominal CT Image Super Resolution". Full text can be found in "MSc_thesis.pdf".

# Data
The abdominal dataset used in the paper can be found in http://medicaldecathlon.com/. The pancreas dataset was comprised of patients undergoing resection of pancreatic masses. Images were provided by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre located in New York, United States. Among the 420 images, 281 have corresponding segmentation information on pancreatic parenchyma and pancreatic mass. Full description of the dataset can be found in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09063.pdf.
